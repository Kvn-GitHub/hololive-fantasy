            <div class="description">Flare is a kind and extremely humble individual, almost to a fault. Her kindness is
                vouched for most often by the other hololive Fantasy members, which has resulted in her so-called
                'harem,' with Pekora being an exception. However, out of the four members in hololive Fantasy, it
                remains to be Noel who is the most blatant in her affection.
