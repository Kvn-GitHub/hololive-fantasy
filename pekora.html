            <div class="description">Pekora hails from the nation of Pekoland, where she claims she is a member of
                royalty. While not much is currently known about Pekoland, it is assumed that its denizens are, like
                Pekora, Animals humans with rabbit-ears and comparatively long lifespans, and that the rabbit-motif
                apparent in Pekora's fashion and accessories is significant to their culture.
