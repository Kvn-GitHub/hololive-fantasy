                        <li><b>2020</b> - On 13 March, she announced on her Twitter account the demonetization of her
                            channel, apparently for sexual content. She also stated that for the last 4 months every
                            video had the yellow monetization symbol, which means monetization coming for advertisement
                            on her channel was already limited.</li>
                        <li><b>2021</b> - On 18 July, Marine announced during a short stream that she would go on a
                            hiatus from streaming to heal her throat.[28] Despite this, she continued her streaming
                            activities as normal, though she had to speak less in an effort to recover her throat's
                            condition. On 29 July, Marine debuted her fourth 2D costume during a stream, Marine got
                            ponytail and straight hairstyles, her clothes include a black and white cap decorated with
                            heart-shaped shades, with a golden anchor connecting the lenses.

                            It is worth noting that this outfit design dates back to 9 July 2020 first seen as an
